Add a carousel to your website. Based on the Owl Carousel, a responsive and fully customizable carousel.

== Installation ==
Extract the zip file and upload the contents to the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the plugin from the plugins page.


A new Owl Carousel menu item will be visible in the admin menu. Create a new category and add as much items as you need (use the featured image to define the item image).


Now, you can add your carousel into any post with the following shortcode (or using the custom TinyMCE button):

[owl-carousel]
To edit the carousel options (items per slide, auto play...) you just need to add options in the shortcode:

[owl-carousel category="Uncategorized" items="1" autoPlay="true"]
Notice the category option to display items from a specific category.


You can checkout the available options on the Owl carousel website:
